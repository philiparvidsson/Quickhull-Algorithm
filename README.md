# alg-quickhull

Assignment for Algorithms VT15P4 (21AL1B)

Implementation of the quickhull algorithm + Akl-Toussaint heuristic for realtime visualization and comparison of efficiency. Enjoy!

This was actually an assignment, hence the documentation and source comments are in Swedish. If you're interested in a translation, drop me a message.

    KEYS
    ----------------
    Key    Effect
    
      a    Toggles Akl-Toussaint heuristic.
      b    Toggles black hole (gravity towards center).
      d    Toggles damping.
      f    Toggles sloped floor.
      g    Toggles gravity.
      h    Toggles hull rendering.
      l    Toggles hull lock (locks hull to its current point set).
      p    Toggles point rendering.
      q    Toggles between bruteforce and quickhull.
      r    Toggles rubber band mode (hull becomes a rubber band).
      w    Toggles wind.
      x    Randomizes point velocities.
      z    Randomizes point positions.
